## Autowiring

No configuration needed. Just type-hint your constructor parameters and the container can guess which dependencies to inject.

```PHP
class Bar {}
class Foo {
    public $bar;
    public function __construct(Bar $bar, $id = null, $alias = null) {
        $this->bar = $bar;
    }
}

$container = new Container;
$foo = $container->create(Foo::class);
```
In example above, a new ``Bar`` instance is created automatically each time ```Foo``` is created. This mechanism rely on ```Reflection``` to resolve objects dependencies.
