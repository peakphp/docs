# Dependency Injection

This package allows you to standardize and centralize the way objects are constructed in your application and fully compatible with [PSR-11](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/).

This package is already part of Peak Framework but can be also used as standalone:

```bash
$ composer require peak/di
```
