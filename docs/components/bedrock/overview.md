# Overview

### Creating an HTTP application

To create an new application instance, you need 3 things:

 - a *PSR-11* Container
 - Kernel with an environment
 - Handlers resolvers.

```php
$container = new Container(); // PSR-11
$kernel = new Kernel('prod', $container);
$app = new Application(
    $kernel,
    new HandlerResolver(),
    '2.0.0', // optional, default is 1.0
)
```

### How it works ?

The application is essentially a stack of resources acting as request middleware and handler. 
When a *PSR-7* request is send to the `Application`, the main stack is resolved and executed. 

There is two outcomes possible when the main stack is resolved:
 
1. It stop when a *PSR-7* response is returned.
2. It throw an exception because no response have been returned.

### How to build your stack

Adding stuff to your `Application` stack in done with method `add()` and `set()`.
They work both the same way except that `add()` append stuff the stack and  `set()` overwrite what was previously added to the stack.

```php
$app->add(MiddlewareA::class);
$app->add([
    MiddlewareB::class, 
    MiddlewareC::class
]);
```
If we were processing request here, middlewares A, B and C would have been executed.

### How to process a server request 

To handle an `Application` server request, you need a compatible *PSR-7* library. 

By default, Peak come with Zend/Diactoros, but you can use many others.

Example with Zend/Diactoros:
```php
$request = ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals();

try {
    $response = $app->handle($request);
    // ...
} catch(Exception $e) {
    // ...
}
```

### How to output the response

The easiest way to output a *PSR-7* response is to use `Peak\Bedrock\Http\Response\Emitter`.

```php
$response = $app->handle($request);

// ... do something with the response

$emitter = new Emitter();
$emitter->emit($response);
```

Or use Application::run()

```php
$app->run($request, new Emitter());
```

### Complete Application example from A to Z

Now that you know how an `Application` works, lets try a more real usage. 
We will use `ApplicationFactory` to create our app.

```php
use Peak\Di\Container; // PSR-11
use Peak\Bedrock\ApplicationFactory; // PSR-15
use Peak\Bedrock\Http\Response\Emitter;
use Zend\Diactoros\ServerRequestFactory; // PSR-7

// Create app with factory
$appFactory = new ApplicationFactory();
$app = $appFactory->create('dev', new Container());

// Adding multiple middlewares and route middleware to application stack
$app->add([
    BootstrapMiddleware::class,
    $app->all('/', [
        CookieMiddleware::class,
        HomePageHandler::class
    ]),
    $app->get('/user/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)', [
        UserProfileHandler::class
    ]),
    $app->post('/userForm/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)', [
        AuthenticationMiddleware::class,
        UserFormHandler::class
    ]),
    LogNotFoundMiddleware::class
    PageNotFoundHandler::class
]);

// Execute the app stack
try {
    // create response emitter
    $emitter = new Emitter();
    
    // create request from globals
    $request = ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals();
    
    // handle request and emit app stack response
    $app->run($request, $emitter);
    
} catch(Exception $e) {
    // overwrite app stack with error middleware
    $app->set(new DevExceptionHandler($e))
        ->run($request, $emitter);
}

```
```
