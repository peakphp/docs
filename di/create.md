### How method create() work
The method create() will help you to instantiate objects. It is important to understand that **enabling/disabling autowiring affect how this method create objects.

Autowiring is enabled by default. To change this, use ```disableAutowiring()```. 

Under the hood, ```create()``` go through those steps in order:

When Autowiring is enabled :

* Check constructor type-hinted argument(s) using ```Reflection```.
* Check for ```$explicit``` definition(s) to overload/guide the resolver.
* If no ```$explicit```, look for a stored instance in the container, or instantiate a new one.
   
When Autowiring is disabled:

* Check for ```$explicit``` definition(s) to overload/guide the resolver.
* If no ```$explicit```, look for a matching [definition]({{ site.url }}di/definitions) and resolve it.


### method get() is also used by create() when autowiring is enabled

```
$foo1 = $container->get(Foo::class);
$foo2 = $container->create(Foo::class);
```

In the example above, if your container don't have a stored instance of Foo class, both methods get() and create() will return a new instance of Foo each time. But, if your container have a Foo instance stored, only method create() return a new instance of Foo each time.

In other word, when autowiring is enabled, create() always return a new instance and get() only create a new instance if no stored instance match.




#### Parameters
```php
create(string $class [, array $args = [] [, mixed $explicit = null ]]])
```

```$class``` 

Represent the class string name you want to create.

```$args```

Represent other(s) non-object parameters if apply (or arguments if you prefer).

```php
class Foo {
    public function __construct(Bar $bar, $id = null, $desc = null) {
        $this->bar = $bar;
    }
}

$foo = $container->create(Foo::class, [
    12, // $id
    'FooBar' // $desc
]);
```

```$explicit```

Because autowiring is not always able to resolve an interface, you need to specify in those cases how the container should resolve it.

Also, because this parameters can be also used to bypass a definition and/or a stored instance, you should only use it when you have no other choice. A better choice would be to rethink which object need to be stored or disable autowiring and use bind definition to control more precisely your objects creations.

```php
interface InterfaceA {}
class A implements InterfaceA {}
class B implements InterfaceA {}

class Foo {
    public function __construct(InterfaceA $a) {
        $this->a = $a;
    }
}

// throw an exception, there is no InterfaceA stored in container
$foo = $container->create(Foo::class);

// by adding class A instance, the container is now able to 
// resolve correctly InterfaceA in ```Foo``` constructor
$container->add(new A);
$foo = $container->create(Foo::class);

// now we add another class that implements InterfaceA so you
// need to specify which one to use, otherwise, it will throw an exception
$container->add(new B);
$foo = $container->create(Foo::class, [], [
    InterfaceA::class => A::class
]);

// you can also directly bypass the container by
// creating a new instance of B for InterfaceA
$foo = $container->create(Foo::class, [], [
    InterfaceA::class => function() {
        return new B;
    }
]);
```
